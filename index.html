<p>Have you ever thought about how kids get to school? Sometimes they could get a ride from their parents, they could take a train or bus, or maybe even walk. Have you ever thought about people who live in remote locations? Sometimes, it's really hard for them to get around. We want this problem to be solved.</p>
<p>Say hello to the telepresence robot. The idea behing the telepresence robot is to give users the ability to project their presence to a remote location through a robot. We feel like this is an important part in education, espicially for kids who can't get to school all the time. </p>
